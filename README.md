# Real time Notifications in Blazor 🔔
I've put together this real-time notifications example using SignalR, integrating a sleek top bar component into the project. Steering away from the typical Snackbar examples adds a touch of professionalism and elegance to your application.

## How it Works
- Notifications Service: We'll use it as a class to inject into the necessary components (in this case, the "NotificationsMenu" component).
- NotificationsMenu Component: Displays the count of unread notifications and allows users to view all notifications.
- SignalR: Used for real-time updates.
- SweetAlert2: Used to display notifications.
